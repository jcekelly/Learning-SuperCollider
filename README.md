# Learning-SuperCollider

I have recently begun learning how to code with SuperCollider, an 'open source software environment and dynamic coding language for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition'

Learning SuperCollider is just something I am doing for fun, but it does have the added bonus of giving me a deeper understanding of Object-Orientated Programming and it's fundamental concepts - I'm excited to discover more ways to code creatively.
